The project given was to code variables in JavaScript.
It focused on using arrays and functions to make a tangible and legible project.
The 3 main questions were:

      a. Student Grade Generator- This prompted the user to input student grades scored. 
                                  The function that I primarily used was 'let' to assign variables.
                                  
      b. Net Salary Calculator- This required the programmer to print the net income of a person's salary post deductions.
                                This was the hardest to do as it required to be thoroughly thought out.
        
      c. Speed Detector- The user input the speed of passing vehicles, and only speeds below 70km/h were acceptable.
                         This required the use of math, primarily subtractions and division.
